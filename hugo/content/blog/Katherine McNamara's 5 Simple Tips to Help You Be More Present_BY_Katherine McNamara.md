<span class="dropcap">Y</span>ear after year, our world gets busier, more fast-paced, and more electronic. These new ways to connect can bring us closer and make life easier, but also it causes us to forget to connect in person from time to time. It’s important to take time out of your busy day to remember to be present and find those little moments of joy in the mundane. 

Here are my five simple ways to remind yourself to be present and joyful every day.

## 1. Try Something New. 
You never know what could bring you joy if you never try! The rush of something new can be exciting and forces you to break your everyday pattern. It can be something simple like trying a new coffee shop in the morning or something bigger like [playing a new sport.](http://advice.shinetext.com/articles/how-running-became-my-best-therapy/) It helps you grow as a person to put yourself out there. 

## 2. Phone a Friend.
Pick someone at random from your contacts list. It could be someone you talked to yesterday or someone you haven't spoken to for years. Give them a ring! Don't text, actually pick up the phone and call them. Have a real, present conversation. Ask them about their day, their life, and their favorite things! Reconnecting with another human you care about is one of the best feelings.

## 3. Take Yourself on a Date. 
Take [a moment of quiet for yourself](http://advice.shinetext.com/articles/productivity-hacks-to-get-your-me-time-back/) on occasion. Go to the park, have a picnic, read a book, go to your favorite restaurant, go see a movie, go for a run, do something that makes YOU happy. Simply taking time to reflect by yourself doing an activity you love can allow you the space to clear your head and reconnect with yourself.

## 4. Talk to Strangers. 
I know, I know… this is technically not what you're supposed to do BUT - it’s not what you're thinking. All I'm saying is put yourself out there sometimes. Say “hi” to someone walking by, tell someone you like their shoes, their smile, or their scarf, strike up a conversation with your waiter or the cashier or the person in line behind you! In doing so, you will probably make that person’s day, and your own in the process.

## 5. Celebrate You!
In all this connecting with other people, don't forget about yourself! Find something about yourself that you feel confident about. It could be your smile, your walk, your sense of style, your math skills, or anything you love about you! Think about that when you get up in the morning and do what you can to make that stand out. It will give you that extra boost of confidence and remind you that you are extra special.

By taking a moment every day to do even one of these five suggestions, you can remind yourself to appreciate those special little moments in life. Life is crazy - we all know that - but by being present and joyful with those around you and in those moments, you can really live.
