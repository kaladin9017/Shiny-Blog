TGIF from the Shine team! 

This week at Shine we were inspired by [Mahershala Ali](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/mahershala-ali-becomes-the-first-muslim-actor-to-win-an-oscar_us_58b3866fe4b060480e0905d3) and Viola Davis’ Oscar wins, LOLed over [this](https://twitter.com/stealthmountain) (oldie but goodie) Twitter bot, reminded each other not to fall into the [Perfectionist Trap](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BY6bGhcnDDs), thought about how we would [spend $1,700](http://giveaways.fab.com/landing?promo_id=758f015b-9a32-4d96-97b2-7fbefa1701be&campaign_id=1083&utm_campaign=Revive-Re-energize&utm_medium=sweeps&utm_source=Shine-Text) to have the best day ever, and applauded [Nike](http://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/nike-plus-size-fitness-wear) for rolling out plus-sized fitness wear.

## Here’s what we shared this week’s Shine texts: 

[4 Things Hopeful People Do Better:](https://classpass.com/blog/2017/01/04/reasons-to-be-hopeful/) Ask "what could go right?"How to be a voice, not an echo.

[Why you need to stop stressing about being perfect:](http://lifehacker.com/how-i-got-over-my-fear-of-confrontation-and-learned-to-1699617728) Perfectionism puts the focus on others, instead energize yourself first. 

[20 Things that Will Matter a Lot Less to You in 20 Years:](http://www.marcandangel.com/2017/01/29/20-things-that-will-matter-a-lot-less-to-you-in-20-years/?utm_source=FBMessenger&utm_medium=Shine) Ask yourself, “will this matter in 20 years?”

[Everyone Should Make Time for Daydreaming:](http://nymag.com/scienceofus/2016/10/how-to-be-more-creative-spend-more-time-daydreaming.html?utm_source=FBMessenger&utm_medium=Shine) Daydreaming helps us get creative with our problems.
