<span class="dropcap">W</span>e caught up with singer Becky G about her new single “Todo Cambió,” the positive changes that happened in her life this year, and how practicing self-love changed her life for the better.

## What is the inspiration behind your new single “Todo Cambió?”

__Becky:__ Todo Cambió is a song about __*change.*__ The song was inspired by my personal experience [going through change](http://advice.shinetext.com/articles/how-to-channel-your-passion-into-positive-change/?utm_source=Shine&utm_medium=Blog) in love and my career. When I made this song, there was a beautiful shift in my life. I fell in love, I decided to record my first Spanish album, I was filming my very first movie and living on my own for the very first time. A lot of firsts! Everything was different, but a good kind of different. The kind of different that helped me grow and inspired me to [take control of my life](http://advice.shinetext.com/articles/4-ways-to-control-your-inner-control-freak/?utm_source=Shine&utm_medium=Blog) in a way that I hadn't before. 

> Love from the right places. I stopped looking for it and instead it just came. Self-love. Family love. Real love.  <a href="http://ctt.ec/Qda7x"><img src="//images.contentful.com/awpxl2koull4/6LvAGoJrjOEwQY86uMuS6q/4b6c5fd47467193f78e2dda0ef592d60/Twitter_Logo_Blue.png?h=42" alt="Tweet "></a>

With the Todo Cambió music video, I wanted to continue the inspiration from my last two music videos about empowerment and make what feels like a movie [to] tell a story. This story is about a young woman who isn't living her life for herself. Instead, she's going through the motions of life simply to please her parents and family. Although everything in her life is good. She's smart, hardworking, in a relationship with a good guy, she quickly learns that their idea of “picture perfect” isn't her kind of perfect. Deep down inside she knows something is missing... real love. 

Everything changes, as the song goes, when she meets someone who makes her feel different inside-- someone who inspires her, intrigues her, pushes her. Someone who gives her this sense of adventure, motivating her to break out of the mold and grow into a young adult who lives life by her own rules.

## What changed for you for the better in the past year?
__Becky:__ [There was] love from the right places. I stopped looking for it and instead it just came. Self-love. Family love. Real love.

## What advice would you give to fans who are looking to make a positive change in their life?

__Becky:__ You are who you surround yourself with. Cutting toxic-negative people from your life is a big step toward a new positive energy. Focus on making the relationships with good people in life stronger. Those are the ones you can count on. 

## What is one thing you do every day to help feel your best?

__Becky:__ When you wake up in the morning and get ready for bed, take 5-10 minutes to meditate and give your brain a break. Focus on your breathing. Inhale the positive and exhale the negative. 

## What would you tell fans who are struggling with their confidence?

__Becky:__ Self-love is the most important. When you accept and love yourself first, everything else falls into place.  <a href="http://ctt.ec/dOYGi"><img src="//images.contentful.com/awpxl2koull4/6LvAGoJrjOEwQY86uMuS6q/4b6c5fd47467193f78e2dda0ef592d60/Twitter_Logo_Blue.png?h=42" alt="Tweet "></a>


## What's your favorite quote around confidence?
__Becky:__ You were given this life because you are strong enough to live it.  <a href="http://ctt.ec/3cC7i"><img src="//images.contentful.com/awpxl2koull4/6LvAGoJrjOEwQY86uMuS6q/4b6c5fd47467193f78e2dda0ef592d60/Twitter_Logo_Blue.png?h=42" alt="Tweet "></a>
