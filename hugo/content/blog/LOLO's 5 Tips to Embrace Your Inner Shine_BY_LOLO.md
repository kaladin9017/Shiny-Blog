## What inspired you to write the song “Shine?”

Shine is about discovering how strong you are by the things you’ve had to overcome. I’ve struggled with depression (among other things)  in the past and I reached a point where I had to decide what I wanted to do about it. Was I gonna sit around and let it continue to own me or was I going to put my big girl pants on and deal with my shit? I chose the latter and I’m so glad I did. 

> Go ahead and Shine.

## What tips would you give people to encourage them to Shine?

## 1. Be your own beautiful. 
We each have [our own special routine](http://advice.shinetext.com/articles/the-importance-of-a-daily-routine/) that helps make us feel comfortable in our own skin. Making time for these things will help you get in the right headspace to be able to take on whatever challenges come up, especially on the days when you can’t be bothered. 

## 2. Have a daily dance party. 
Before I leave the house in the AM, I [have a dance party](http://advice.shinetext.com/articles/5-simple-ways-to-lighten-up-laughter-heavy/) and let any anxiety take a hike. A few of my fave dancing tracks are “Freedom! ’90” by George Michael, “Never Be Like You” by Flume, “You Oughta Know” by Alanis Morissette, and “Shut Up & Dance” by WALK THE MOON.

## 3. Don’t forget to breathe. 
This may seem like a no-brainer, but we’re not always aware that we may not be breathing properly. Anxiety, stress and other similar factors can greatly affect our breathing. Taking a few minutes out of your day to find your breath and recenter helps keep the stress levels low.

## 4. Eat what you love. 
We’re all trying to ‘keep it tight’ these days. Healthy living and eating are a great practice but it can become mentally taxing if you’re constantly restricting yourself from your fave foods. Food is a very important and personal thing to each of us and life is really short…so eat the cookie. 

## 5. Put yourself first. 
We spend most of our time [worrying about other people’s needs](http://advice.shinetext.com/articles/im-good-with-whatever-the-high-price-of-people-pleasing/) and wants. Ultimately, you’re the only person who can know what you need, but if you’re not staying in tune with that it’s very easy to lose track. Be good to yourself.  

Go ahead and Shine. <3
