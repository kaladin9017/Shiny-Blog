*5 Things to Do When You Feel Like Life is Getting Out of Control was written by Sara Fry and originally appeared on [Way Up](https://www.wayup.com/).* 

<span class="dropcap">S</span>o you’re feeling like you’re running around like a chicken with your head cut off. Whether you’ve got too many assignments for your classes, too much work at your internship, or too much drama with your friends, there are plenty of things out there that’ll stress you out.

The good news, though, is you don’t have to feel like you have no say in any of it. Here are five of my favorite strategies for getting back in control when you feel like your life is spinning in every direction.

## 1. Clean

I’m sure that your room is probably a mess if you feel out of control! My advice? Open the windows and start cleaning! Do your laundry, change your bedding, and take your rugs outside and shake them off. Sweep and mop. If your living space allows it, light a candle!Just get it all [clean.](http://advice.shinetext.com/articles/how-to-spring-clean-your-whole-life/?utm_source=Shine&utm_medium=Blog)

Now look around; isn’t it pretty? Breathe in deep and enjoy a tidy space.

## 2. Exercise

Get out and exercise, because nobody can keep you from doing that for your body. Plus, it will relieve some stress. As a student, typically there is a recreation center available to you for no charge. And if not, get outside, and [run around your area or on a trail](http://advice.shinetext.com/articles/how-running-became-my-best-therapy/?utm_source=Shine&utm_medium=Blog).

Even if you feel like going out isn’t for you, there are plenty of exercises you can do from the comfort of your own home. Here are some great options I like to refer to:

## 3. Start With Small Goals

Making a small goal for yourself can make you feel like you achieved something and therefore feel more in control. Just make sure it is something you can achieve on your own, otherwise, someone else is controlling your success.

Stumped on how to start? Here are a few suggestions:

<p> 1. Work out everyday for a week.</p>
<p> 2. Don’t drink any soda for a certain number of days. </p>
<p> 3. Drink eight glasses of water per day for a week straight. </p>
<p> 4. Journal every day for a week. </p>
<p> 5. Make your bed every morning for a week. </p>
<p> 6. Learn five new vocabulary words per week for the next month. </p>

Also, don’t be afraid to tell friends and family about what you’re trying to achieve. Accountability is everything.

## 4. Plan

Pull out your planner, and if you don’t have one, it’s time to buy one, go check out this post for some suggestions.

I find that sitting down and planning out my week or month really helps me to get a handle on things and get rid of that chaotic, out-of-control feeling. There are a lot of different ways to plan, and I would highly recommend you experiment with them and figure out what works best for you!

Here are some good planning resources:

## 5. Create Your Own Momentum

If you know why you [feel out of control](http://advice.shinetext.com/articles/4-ways-to-control-your-inner-control-freak/?utm_source=Shine&utm_medium=Blog), see if there are small actions you can take to change course.

Maybe it’s a group project and someone is bossing you around on your part. Stand your ground and politely tell him or her, “Hey, this is my part of the assignment, let me give it a shot. And if it doesn’t work or doesn’t fit the guidelines, I will fix it.”

Maybe your friend is controlling your social life; let her know that you need to be allowed to have other friends or even stop talking to her for a short period of time. You don’t have to vow to change everything overnight, but small steps lead to much bigger things.

I hope you’re feeling a little more in control after completing this list! If you have other suggestions, share them in the comments below!
